My Neovim configuration that I use for pretty much everything I do on my computer.

## Introduction
I began learning vim motions while using vscode starting in January 2024 as a
result of burnout, and because I was binging a lot of [The Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagen) on YouTube.
Watching the speed at which he was moving around between files and editing text
was just absolutely astounding to me, so I set off to try and learn how to do
what he was doing. At first, it sort of felt like I was playing a little mini-game
while I was programming, which helped me to stay focused. After basically crippling
my ability to type or move fast at all while programming, I slowly started getting better and
better, and eventually I actually became faster than I ever was before using vim motions.

Also, I watched [these tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm323Lc7iSW_wuxqmKx_xxNtJC_hJbQ7R) a few times each which helped me learn some
more advance movements.

Eventually, I started to get interested in using Neovim as a replacement for
vscode because I'm not like the other girls. By following the [Primeagen's
guide](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE?si=VJtjJaHgbMDPpGRT) on how to set up Neovim,
plus a couple hours of troubleshooting, I was able to stand up my initial
Neovim configuration. Over the past few months I've added a bunch of plugins that
have really helped me to be more productive. My two favorite are:
* [Harpoon](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon)
    * File navigation help, once you get good you can really just fly around your
    projects.
* [vim-jukit](https://github.com/luk400/vim-jukit)
    * Create and run Jupyter notebooks in your terminal!

## Installation
1. Follow Neovim's installation instructions here:
https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md

2. Clone this repository somewhere, and move the "after/" and "lua/" directories
and the "init.lua" file to your ~/.config/nvim/ directory.

3. *Optional* I don't like typing "nvim" to open Neovim, it's just soooooooooo
many letters. Instead I went into my bashrc file and added the following line:
```bash
alias vim='nvim'
```
Just think about how many seconds this saves over the course of your life! Thank
me later.

4. Now it's time to actually install the plugins. Navigate to the ~/.config/nvim/
directory and type the following command:
```bash
$ nvim lua/graham/packer.lua
```
Or, if you put the alias in your bashrc file:
```bash
$ vim lua/graham/packer.lua
```

Once there, type the following command:
```vim
:so
```
This will source the packer.lua file and allow you to run packer commands. Next,
run the following command:
```vim
:PackerSync
```

Now you should start to see a bunch of stuff getting installed, nice!

5. There's one more step, which is to open up Mason and start to install some
language servers and formatters. Below I've put a list of all the ones I have
installed:
* cmake-language-server (cmake language server)
* clangd (c++ and c language server)
* efm (general purpose language server)
* jedi-language-server (python language server)
* clang-format (c++ and c formatting)
* black (python formatting)
* lua-language-server (lua language server)
* html-lsp (html language server)
* ltex-ls (latex language server)
* marksman (markdown language server)
* shfmt (shell formatting)
* stylua (lua formatting)

## Usage
My config has a bunch of plugins and custom keybindings. I would recommend watching
The Primeagen's video on his Neovim setup at the very least so you can listen to
an explanation of the more general purpose custom keybinds that I use to navigate around.

The main (and I think only) difference between the basic keybindings
of my config and The Primeagen's is that I only use "ctrl+k" and "ctrl+j" to move
between files in Harpoon. For reference, The Primeagen only uses "ctrl+j",
"ctrl+k", "ctrl+l", and "ctrl+;" to move between files, which means he can only
have four files in his Harpoon buffer at a time. My projects usually use a lot
more than four files, so I like to be able have as many as I want and just scroll
through the list with "ctrl+j" and "ctrl+k".

To finish, I have a quick note on my C++ language server setup. Since I'm using
clangd, it's important to have a compile_commands.json file in the root of your
project. This file is generated by cmake, and it tells clangd how to compile your
project. If you don't have this file, clangd will not be able to provide you with
any code completion and your files will be literally full of errors. To avoid this,
put the following command in your cmake file somewhere:
```cmake
set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)
```
This should put a compile_commands.json file in the build directory of your
cmake project.

For C projects, you can use [bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) to generate
the compile_commands.json file.
